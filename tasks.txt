✅ Core Features

These are essential, nearly universal across EMRs:

Task Creation
- Manual entry by users (clinicians, nurses, admin).
- Auto-generated by the system (e.g. follow-up after lab result, incomplete documentation).

Task Assignment
- Assign to individuals or roles (e.g. Nurse, PCP, Billing).
- Teams or pools (e.g. Radiology Review Team).

Task Status Tracking
- States: New, In Progress, Completed, Deferred, Cancelled.
- Timestamp logs: created, started, completed.

Due Dates & Prioritization
- Standard due date and time.
- Priority tags: Low, Medium, High, Urgent.

Notifications & Alerts
- In-system notifications.
- Email/SMS/push depending on integration.
- Alert for overdue or critical tasks.

Audit Trail
- Who created, modified, completed, reassigned, etc.
- Required for compliance (HIPAA, etc.).


Clinical Use Case Examples
Understanding the 'why' behind tasks:

Task Triggered By	Example Task				Assigned To
Lab Result Received	Review critical potassium level		PCP
Patient Discharge	Schedule follow-up appointment		Front Desk
Medication Refill Req.	Approve refill request for Lisinopril	Provider/Nurse
Encounter Completed	Finalize documentation / billing codes	Provider / Biller

Optional but Valuable Features
Recurring Tasks
- For chronic care plans (e.g. "Check BP every 3 months").

Task Templates
- Predefined task flows for common procedures (e.g. Pre-op checklist).

Dependencies
- Task A must be completed before Task B.

Task Comments/Notes
- Add reasoning, status updates, questions.

Attachment Support
- Link to patient chart section, documents, lab results.

Custom Categories or Tags
- E.g. “Urgent Labs,” “Patient Communications,” “Billing Review”

Analytics & Reporting
- Outstanding tasks by user/team.
- SLA compliance tracking.
- Bottleneck analysis.

Security and Compliance Considerations
- Role-based access control (RBAC): Only authorized users can view/edit.
- PHI handling: Avoid exposing sensitive info in task titles/comments unless secure.

Modern UI/UX Practices
- Kanban-style task boards (like Trello-style workflows).
- Smart filters: My Tasks, Team Tasks, Overdue, Due Today.
- Mobile-friendly interfaces for clinicians on rounds.

Suggestion: Modular Task Framework
- Design your Tasks module with extensibility: 
    - Task Trigger → Task Template → Assignment Rule → Notification Rule
- This lets you scale easily from basic reminders to complex workflows.
