Patient Charting – Functional Medicine Style
Core Charting Components (General EMR)
These are essential for all EMRs, and will also apply to Functional Medicine:
1.	Chief Complaint
2.	History of Present Illness (HPI)
3.	Review of Systems (ROS)
4.	Physical Exam
5.	Past Medical History
6.	Family History
7.	Social History
8.	Allergies
9.	Medications
10.	Immunizations
11.	Vital Signs
12.	Assessment & Plan
13.	Lab/Imaging Orders
14.	Progress Notes
15.	SOAP or APSO Notes

Functional Medicine-Specific Additions
These extend the conventional components to fit functional medicine philosophy, focusing on root cause analysis, systems biology, and personalized care:
1. Functional Medicine Timeline
•	Purpose: Life story visualized chronologically to identify root causes and triggers.
•	Features:
o	Life events (trauma, illness, exposures, stress)
o	Environmental & genetic influences
o	Onset of symptoms
2. Matrix Model (IFM Matrix)
•	Purpose: Organizes clinical data by functional systems.
•	Systems:
o	Assimilation (digestion, absorption, microbiome)
o	Defense & Repair (immune)
o	Energy (mitochondrial, thyroid, adrenal)
o	Biotransformation & Elimination (detox pathways)
o	Transport (cardiovascular, lymph)
o	Communication (hormonal, neurotransmitter)
o	Structural Integrity (musculoskeletal, cellular)
UI Suggestion: Consider a graphical chart or modular layout per system.
3. Lifestyle and Modifiable Factors
•	Components:
o	Sleep & relaxation
o	Exercise & movement
o	Nutrition & hydration
o	Stress & resilience
o	Relationships & community
o	Environment (toxins, EMF, mold, etc.)
•	Track as interventions and progress notes.
4. Nutrition & Supplements Tracker
•	Prescribed or recommended dietary protocols
•	Supplements (type, dose, duration, brand)
•	Food sensitivities, allergies, elimination protocols
5. Health Goals & Patient Priorities
•	Patient-defined outcomes
•	Personalized wellness plans
•	SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
