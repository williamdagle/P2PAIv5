  # Temporarily Disable RLS for Data Seeding Tables

  1. Purpose
    - Disable RLS on tables that need bulk data insertion
    - This is temporary and should be re-enabled after seeding
    
  2. Tables Affected
    - All patient charting tables that are failing with permission errors
    
  3. Security Notes
    - IMPORTANT: This is temporary for data seeding only
    - RLS should be re-enabled immediately after seeding completes
    - Do NOT use this in production without RLS enabled
