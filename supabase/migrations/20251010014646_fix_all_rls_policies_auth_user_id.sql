/*
  # Fix All RLS Policies to Use auth_user_id

  1. Issue
    - Many policies incorrectly use `users.id = auth.uid()`
    - Should use `users.auth_user_id = auth.uid()`
    - This is preventing users from accessing their own data
    
  2. Solution
    - Drop and recreate all affected policies with correct auth_user_id reference
    - This fixes access control for all patient charting tables
